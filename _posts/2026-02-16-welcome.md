I'm working on a realtime destruction system my game. It's similar to the ones found in the games "Red Faction Guerrilla" (RFG) and "Red Faction Armageddon" (RFA). I'm writing it in C# using a custom engine/framework. I'll be posting videos, pictures, bugs, and more here soon.

For now, here's some pictures of the editor and some debug UIs. Using Dear ImGui for the UI.

GPU memory overlay. Hooked up to vulkan memory allocator. Despite what the UI says I don't actually have 56.54GB of VRAM (sadly).

Profiling/timing gui. While this is useful for quick performance checks, I'd like to integrate Tracy profiler in the near future. It makes it much easier to track performance across many frames and threads and has many other useful features.
